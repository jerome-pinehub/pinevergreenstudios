      Vision Entertainment Group functions as a consortium of voices from private 
      citizens, industry professionals, paraprofessionals, and laymen who share 
      concerns as an advocacy group over the image and content of entertainment 
      being presented to our children and youth. We are people just like you who 
      are tired of furthering the message of immoral and degrading entertainment. 
      We must come together to advocate for new rating sysetem presently used 
      by the broadcast and gaming industries; especially ratings, for children's 
      entertainment. <br>
      <br>
      The ratings of aired cable television programs are not appropriate for family 
      viewing among children and youth. The content of aired radio programming 
      has been fused with deplorable language and demoralizing messages which 
      makes it unfit for listening. Video games glorify hostility and death in 
      a pungent setting of rage. They are at best substandard and lower in the 
      values which constitute a wholesome society and community. </font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are the people who ask the 
        questions; &#8220;What is happening to the family entertainment industry?&#8221;, 
        &#8220;Is there anything good on the radio or television I can enjoy with 
        my children?&#8221;, &#8220;Are there any descent family shows or events 
        to go to?&#8221; And, now the electronic age of the internet threatens 
        the very integrity of family values. Who are going to monitor the ratings 
        of what our children are seeing, hearing, and doing? </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We desire to offer alternatives 
        to the rating system for aired broadcasts, public events, and electronic 
        games presented to children and youth which will bare the &#8220;Family 
        Vision Entertainment Group&#8217;s&#8221; logo as being rated approved.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Family Vision Entertainment 
        Group is also interested in event productions of its own; as well as, 
        producing, marketing, and promoting events of others which meet the agenda 
        for the family.<br>
